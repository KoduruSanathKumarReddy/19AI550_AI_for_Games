### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221240024
### AIM: 
Develop an AI for Connect 4 that plays optimally by using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, aiming to make the best possible moves to either win or prevent the opponent from winning.


### Algorithm:
	step 1.	Define Board and Helper Functions: Set up the board and functions to check valid moves, drop pieces, and check for a win.
	step 2.	Create Evaluation Function: Score the board based on potential winning alignments.
	step 3.	Implement Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning: Recursively simulate moves, maximizing for the AI and minimizing for the opponent, with pruning.
	step 4.	Determine Best Move: Use Minimax to evaluate each column and choose the highest-scoring move.
	step 5.	Integrate into Game Loop: Alternate turns, check for win/draw conditions, and stop if the game ends.
